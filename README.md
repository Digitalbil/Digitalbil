- 👋 Hi, I’m @Digitalbil aka Digital Bill Lennox
- 👀 I’m interested in coding projects that help people be productive online. I also enjoy automating anything and everything.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write code faster and with less errors and less time needing to be spent on debugging. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects in which other coders are wanting help from other coders.
- 📫 How to reach me? I can be reached via email at bill@billlennox.me or on any number of various messaging or websites that allow messaging.
